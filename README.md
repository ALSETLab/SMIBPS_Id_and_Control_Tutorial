# SMIBPS_Id_and_Control_Tutorial
Tutorial and examples on power system equation-based object-oriented modeling for identification and control.

The goal of the models and software in this project is to illustrate how to build power system object-oriented models using the [OpenIPSL](http://openipsl.org/) library and perform typical tasks involved in modeling, simulation, identification and control design such as linearization, input-signal design, etc.
